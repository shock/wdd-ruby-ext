Handy Ruby extensions.  

I don't take credit for all of these.  Some were 
ripped from blog postings and other sources.  I apologize for failing to give
credit where credit is due.  I will try to give credit for new additions 
added in the future and will happily give proper credit if I am alerted to 
such.
