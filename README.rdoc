Handy Ruby extensions.  

I don't take credit for all of these.  Some were 
ripped from blog postings and other sources.  I apologize for failing to give
credit where credit is due.  I will try to give credit for new additions 
added in the future and will happily give proper credit if I am alerted to 
such.

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but
   bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
