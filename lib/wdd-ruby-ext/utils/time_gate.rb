# TimeGate is a time-based latch.
# When intialized and set with a time period, +wait+ can be called to block the current thread's execution
# until the time period has elapsed.
#
# The idea is that once set, the thread can go about doing other work, then at some point
# wait on the gate to ensure that a certain amount of time has passed before continuing.
# This is specifically useful for throttling API calls.

      # Waits until the gate is opened.
      # +block+ - true by default.  If false, the method will not block, but will return the amount of time
      # left before the gate opens.
      # An optional Ruby block can be passed when +block+ is true that will be evaluated
      # every 0.2 seconds.  If the block evaluates to false, the latch is released and this method returns.
